# CryptoTourism_Csharp_ASP.NET.CORE MVC

This project is my bachelor degree final work for demonstrating my knowledge towards ASP.NET Core 2.2 MVC framework with C# programming language. It is a simple web-application based on browsing interesting Romanian locations (calling them "experiences") by paying with a favourite cryptocurrency. The application has authentification functionalities, Two-Factor Authentification on admin account, search function, filter algorithm and QR Code integration for paying with a chosen cryptocurrency electronic wallet. It has also CRUD operations inside ADMIN account and they can be used as expected, creating a new experience, watch the details of the experience, edit the experience and delete it at the end.

## Getting Started and Prerequisities

All you need to have in order to run my project is ASP.NET Core 2.2 version installed from Microsoft oficial website and Visual Studio IDE. After that, you take off the archive from my GITHUB repository, unzip it on the local computer and run the IIS Express server and you will be able to test my application.

## Running the application

After running the application with IIS Express, you would need to login in order to have access to the list of "experiences" shown. In order to login, you would need to register two types of accounts locally. One is ADMIN account and the other is just another simple account. The admin account needs to be registered with the name of admin@example.com and @Secret12 password. The normal account needs to be registered with whatevername@example.com and a whatever password. After that, you would need to login with the above credentials. The admin account has the CRUD operations as a plus if you go to Experiences Admin page. From there, everything should be straightforward.
